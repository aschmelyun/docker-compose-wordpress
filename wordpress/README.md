## This is where your WordPress installation goes

To get started, delete this README file and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and pull the files for a new WordPress installation by running `docker-compose run --rm wp core download` in your terminal.
